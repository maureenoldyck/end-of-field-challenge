# End of Field Challenge

## ‚≠êÔ∏è The challenge 

This challenge is to evaluate our learnings of the first month in the Junior Developer course at BeCode Ghent

We had to built two full integrations which randomness has assigned to us. Each one of us had been assigned two simple interfaces, and a more complex one. We could choose to build the two simple ones, or one simple AND the complex one. The result had to be pixel-perfect and we weren't allowed to use any css frameworks.
